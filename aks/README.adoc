= AKS Variant

This version of the Rclone module can take advantage of Azure AD Workload Identities (AZWI), in order to access resources on Azure cloud. An introduction to AZWI can be found https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/quick-start.html[Here].

Here below is an example of usage. The resource group, storage account, storage container and federated identities are
not strictly needed by the module, but are inlcuded as an exemple of how to manage them with Terraform, and how to ensure access to the
Rclone pod to those resources.
